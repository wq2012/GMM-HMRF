# GMM-HMRF

## Overview

In this project, we first study the Gaussian-based hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model and its expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then we generalize it to Gaussian mixture model-based hidden Markov random field. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. We also apply this algorithm to color image segmentation problems and 3D volume segmentation problems.
